# Misfortune-Advance
A Game Boy Advance port of the fan game of the creepypasta "Misfortune.GB."

Hello all of you GBA Developers!
I am really glad to see people still interested in a great handheld console.
Today I have a game called Misfortune Advance.

To be clear, it's a demake of a Gaming Creepypasta (called Misfortune.gb) about a creepy hidden game in many 
Cartridges on the 1989 Game Boy. The game got a PC Port in 2013, and it was really good. I was digging for 
a handheld ROM of the game, and found nothing, which sucks because I like this game. So, I decided to make my 
own version on the Game Boy Advance. This version is an adaptation of the PC Remake. This game is fully tested 
and works on hardware.
